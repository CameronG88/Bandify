Description:


    Bandify is an app that allows you to stream music from your favorite artists while simultaneously giving you quick access to artist information. Using the dropdown menu, you can select whether you want to search by artist or album. Whichever criteria you search by, the appropriate response will populate the page.

Criteria


    GIVEN a music streaming app with a search input

    WHEN I search for an artist

    THEN I am presented with a list of that artist’s top 25 songs, a picture of the artist, event info, and a link to the artist’s Facebook page

    WHEN I search for an album

    THEN I am presented with the track list of that album, along with a picture of the album cover

    WHEN I click on a certain song

    THEN I am presented with an appended music player that allows the user a 30 second listen of the song clicked

    WHEN I click on a new song with the music player already displayed

    THEN the current song stops playing and new song comes in

    WHEN I click on one of the author’s Github links
